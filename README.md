# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to control a snake, eat food, and grow longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself while trying to eat as much food as possible.

## Features

- Responsive design: Playable on desktop and mobile devices.
- Keyboard controls: Use arrow keys to change the snake's direction.
- Score tracking: Keep track of the player's score.
- Game over detection: Detect collisions with walls or the snake's body.
- Food spawning: Randomly spawn food for the snake to eat.
